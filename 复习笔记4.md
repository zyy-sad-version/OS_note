* ### Thread definition & thread Usage

*Thread can be viewed as mini-processes within a process*

#### Reason for multiple thread:

​	1. Multiple related activities apply to the same resources, these resources should be accessible/shared (share address space and data)

2. Easy to create and destroy /  10-100 times faster than creating a process

3. Allow activities overlap, thus speeding up the application例如大量的I/O 且当所有线程都受 CPU 限制时没有性能提升

4. Threads are useful on systems with multiple CPUs, where real parallelism is possible(可以实现真正的并行化)

   **They make it possible to retain the idea of sequential processes that make blocking calls and still achieve parallelism.**

#### Thread Usage

* ### Thread vs. processes

  The process model is based on 2 independent concepts:  :

  1. Resource grouping		

  2. Execution trace(for example, an entity that gets executed)can be separated(Thread)

**Multithreading Operating System** support **multiple**, **concurrent** paths of execution within a single process

#### Thread Model

- 进程可以被看作一组相关的资源。进程有一个地址空间包括了program text， program data和其他资源(Open files, child process. pending alarms, single handles, accounting information....). 将他们放在一起便于管理

- 进程的另一个概念是执行线程，通常缩写为只是线程。

线程的组成：![image-20211218103446304](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211218103446304.png)

1. A Program counter： Keeps track of which instruction to execute next.

2. Registers: Hold its current working variables.

3. A Stack:  Contains the execution history, with one frame for each procedure called but not yet returned from(*This frame contains the procedure’s local variables and the return address to use when the procedure call has finished.* ).包含执行历史记录，每个过程被调用但尚未返回一帧。

   **Reason of thread having its own stack**: <u>*Each thread will generally call different procedures and thus have a different execution history.*</u>

4. State: A state can be in any one of serval states: 

   1. running, A running thread currently has the CPU and is active.
   2. blocked, A blocked thread is waiting for some event to unblock it. A thread can block waiting for some external event to happen or for some other thread to unblock it.
   3. ready, A ready thread is scheduled to run and will as soon as its turn comes up.
   4.  terminated, as the same as process.

总结：

**Processes** are used to **group resources together**; **Threads** are the entities **scheduled for execution on the CPU**.

一个进程中并行多个线程类似于多个进程在同一台电脑中并行地运行。前者，线程共享一个地址和其他资源；后者，共享物理内存，硬盘，printer和其他资源。因为线程拥有进程的一些属性，有时线程被称为“lightweight process”

#### Thread control

States of thread can trans like processes(new, running, blocked, ready, terminated)

Thread has **Thread Control Block(TCB)**

#### Why use Thread

* Threads incur **less overhead开销更小** to create/terminate/switch (address space remains the same  for threads of the same process)
* **Inter-thread communication** is easier/faster than **inter-process** communication (threads share memory by default)-->thread can communicate with each other by global variable.

* **No protection boundaries** are required in the address space (threads are cooperating, belong to the same user, and have a common goal, i.e., less system calls)---> all thread exits belong to a single process, will not hurt each other
* Synchronisation has to be considered carefully!    [两线程使用同一文件， 一个线程关闭文件，另一个线程仍然还在读取文件]

Null fork: the overhead in creating, scheduling, running and terminating a null process/thread

Signal wait: overhead in synchronising thread

#### When we use Thread

当使用多线程时，多个依赖相同资源的相关活动，这些资源应该是共享的

进程常常会包括blocking tasks，它们应该并发或并行地执行

Among this time, although there is IO request. process do not block

* ### Different thread implementations

#### OS implementations of Threads

1. User Threads![image-20211218140133827](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211218140133827.png)
2. Kernel Threads![image-20211218140152069](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211218140152069.png)
3. Hybrid implementations![image-20211218140205870](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211218140205870.png)



#### User Threads--- Many to one

* In this implementation: **Thread management** (creating, destroying, scheduling, thread control block manipulation) is carried out **in user space** with the help of a **run-time system**

* The process maintains a **thread table** managed by the **run-time system** without the **kernel’s knowledge**
  * thread Similar to process table
  * Used for thread switching
  * Tracks thread related information

* They can be implemented on OS that does not support multithreading

* Advantage of user threads
  * Threads are in user space, thus, no mode switches require.
  * Full control over the thread scheduler完全控制线程调度程序
  * OS independent (线程能够在不支持它们的操作系统上运行)
  *  The runtime system can switch local blocking threads in user space (e.g. wait for another thread to complete)
* Disadvantage of user threads
  * Blocking system calls suspend the entire process, because OS in kernel, do not know there are multiThread
  * Page fault  (Page fault: *process are divided  into many pages pages that we need  do not exit in main  memory would  cause page fault*) result in **blocking the process**---> one user thread reach page fault, **whole process block**
  * Not true parallelism
  * **Clock interrupts** are non-existent-----because only kernel have clock, runtime system do not have clock, clock interrupt only implement in kernel mode



#### Kernel Thread ---One to one

* The kernel manages the threads, user application accesses threading facilities through API and system calls
  * Thread table is in the kernel, containing thread control blocks
  * If a thread blocks, the kernel chooses thread from the **same or different process**--->If thread 1 reach page fault, it be taken to block queue, it **won't block hole process**.
* Advantage of kernel thread
  * True parallelism can be achieved
  * No run-time system needed
* 一些CPU有硬件直接支持多线程【它们每个核能够支持8个线程】



#### Hybrid Implementations ---Many to Many

* User threads are **multiplexed多路复用** onto kernel threads --multiple user threads on a kernel thread
* Kernel sees and schedules the kernel threads
* User application sees user threads and creates/schedules these 



----

* ### POSIX Thread(PThreads)

All Pthreads threads have certain properties. Each one has an identifier, a set of register(include program counter), and a set of attribute(include the stack size, scheduling parameters, other item)

#### Thread Management

* Thread libraries provide an API/interface for managing threads

![image-20211218151103435](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211218151103435.png)

#### Thread creation 

pthread_create(pthread_t * tidp, pthread_attr_t * attr, void* ( * start_rtn)(void*),void * arg );

当返回值为  0时，创建成功，反之失败

线程被创建，不保证哪一个线程先被运行When a thread is created, there is no guarantee which will run first: the newly created thread or the calling thread.

* pthread_t * tidp ：指向 pthread_t 变量的指针，其中存储了新线程的线程 ID
* pthread_attr_t * attr：指向线程属性对象的指针。如果您将 NULL 作为线程属性传递，则线程将使用默认线程属性创建
* void* ( * start_rtn)(void*)： 指向线程函数的指针
* void * arg ：传递给线程函数的参数

#### Thread termination

一个线程能被三种方式取消

1. The thread can simply return from the start routine. The return value is the thread’s exit code. 
2. The thread can be canceled by another thread in the same process. 
3. The thread can call pthread_exit.
