#### 概念：

1. kernel: is a layer of software to provide user programs with a better, simpler, cleaner model of the computer and to handle managing all the resources.

2. **Abstraction: ** the key to managing all complexity. Good abstractions contain **2** main tasks:

   1. Define and implement abstractions
   2. Use abstractions to solve the problem at hand

3. **An operation system is a layer of indirection on top of the hardware**

4. kernel mode and user mode

   1. **kernel-mode**:  In this mode, it has complete access to all the hardware and can execute any instruction the machine is capable of executing; The operating system runs in kernel mode and has access to all instructions (on desktop and server machines).

      *on most embedded systems, a small piece runs in kernel mod, with the rest of the operating system running in user mode.*

   2. **user mode**:   Only a subset of the machine instructions is available. 

      ;Application run in user mode and have access to a subset of instructions.

5. **Privileged(特权指令) instructions**: instructions available in kernel mode, but not in user mode

6. **System call** :To obtain services from the operating system, a user program must make **system call**, which traps into the kernel and invokes the operating system. *[ The TRAP instruction switched from user mode to kernel mode and starts the operating system.]*

   **Lec problem:**

   **What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain how having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system.**

   Most modern CPUs provide two modes of execution: kernel mode and user mode. The CPU can execute every instruction in its instruction set and use every feature of the hardware when executing in kernel mode. However, it can execute only a subset of instructions and use an only subset of features when executing in the user mode. Having two modes allows designers to run user programs in user mode and thus deny them access to critical instructions.

### LEC02

#### Computer Hardware

* CPU design
  * CPU basic cycle: **fetch, decode, execute**
  * CPU has own instruction set
  * CPU has a set of registers ➡ to store data and for special function 
* **Context switching** ➡  must save and restore the CPU's internal state, include its register.

* Moore's law
  * The number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every 2 years.
* Design for Parallelism
  * replicate the functional units: Superscalar, cache
  * replicate the control logical: hyperthreading
  * replicate the processor: muti-core

* Three walls prevent us from getting more operating power

  ***Previous exam: Describe how, in your opinion, recent developments in computer  architecture and computer design have influenced operating system design***

  * The memory wall:  the increasing gap between processor and memory speeds.
  * The ILP(instruction-level parallelism) wall: the increasing difficulty of finding enough parallelism in a single instruction stream to keep a high-performance single-core processor busy.
  * The power wall: faster computers get really hot and requires much more power

* Interrupts

  * interrupts temporarily pause 暂时暂停a process's normal operation

  * different types of interrupt: 

    * Timer interrupt by CPU clock

      1. timer generates an interrupt

      2. CPU finishes current instruction and tests for interrupt
      3. Transfer to interrupt service routine
         * hardware saves current process (PSW, program counter)
         * Set program counter to interrupt service routine
         * Save registers and other state information
      4. Carry out interrupt service routine(scheduler)

    * I/O interrupts for I/O completion or error codes

    * Software generated. like errors or exceptions

  * **Context switches** can be initiated by timer interrupts after a "**set time**"

- Memory Management Unit:

  Variable are mnemonic(有记忆的) names for memory addresses

  And at runtime, **multiple programs**(processes) will be running on a computer that **share memory**

* The compiler:
  * must **assign a memory address** to variable at compiler time
  * **doesn't know** where in **physical memory** the process will run
  * the compiler assumes that it will start **running at 0(logical address space)**
  * An offset is added at running by the memory management unit(**Physical address space**)

* Modern computers use a logical and physical memory addresses:

  * 理论上每个进程的逻辑地址： 
    $$
    [0, MAX_{64}] 比如32-bit 和64-bit的CPU的地址分别为 2^{32}或2^{64} byte
    $$

  * 每个机器的物理地址取决于机器的物理内存
    $$
    现代个人电脑的内存分别为 512mb， 1gb, 2gb
    $$

* 地址转换发生在MMU（memory management unit）中

### Memory

内存分级用于平衡消耗和性能

* 快速和昂贵的内存用于缓存
* 缓慢且昂贵的内存用于长期储存
* 存储包括register， 一级二级高速缓存，main/core memory， 硬盘

L2 cache 二级高速缓存可以被共享或专用于单独的core

CPU只能直接读取main memory

------

### I/O devices

设备驱动程序通过寄存器与控制器交互，控制器与设备交互  (例如硬盘控制器)

操作系统，设备驱动程序一般通过寄存器与控制器交流

IO能够通过这几种方式发生：

* Busy waiting
* interrupt based
* Direct memory access(DMA)

------

### Structure Operating System

#### Micro Kernels

 Microkernel design achieves **high reliability** by splitting the  operating system up **into small**, **well-defined modules,** only one of which – the **microkernel** - runs in **kernel mode** and the rest run as relatively  powerless ordinary user processes.

* Minimal kernel functionality

  Micro kernel more **easy to extend,**  **more portable**,  **more reliable**

  Mode switch : Frequent system calls and kernel traps cause significant overhead(系统开销，系统开销可能会占用一些资源但是有时候能够提高效率)



#### Monolithic System 单片系统

##### 概念： All procedures are linked together into one <u>*single executable binary program*</u> running in <u>*kernel mode.*</u>

* #### A big mess

  * Monolithic kernels are difficult to maintain----> because: 没有约束的成千上万的互相调用的程序导致了一个不灵便(unwieldy)的系统
  * No information hiding: 每个程序对别的程序都是可见的
