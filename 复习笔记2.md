- #### Processes and their implementation

进程概念：进程是一个程序的**运行实例**
1. The simplified definition: A process is a running instance of a program.

2. A process is basically a program in execution

  process has(program, input, output, state)

- process memory image
  - A **text segment**: program code
  - A **data segment**: process-sepcified data(input ,output ,global variable)
  - A **stack segment**: keep track of active subroutines(function paramrters, local variable)
  - A **heap segment**: hold dynamically allocated data structures or objects the program might need.

* 逻辑地址空间：Every process has its own logical address space, in which the stack and heap are placed at **opposite sides** to allow them to grow

* #### Process state and state transition**重点

1. #### Process States

   * New
   * Ready
   * Running
   * Blocked
   * Exit

2. #### Transitions

   * 1: new -> ready: Admit the process and commit to execution
   * 2: Running -> blocked: Process is waiting for input or carried out a system call.
   * 3: ready -> running: The process is selected by the process **scheduler**.
   * 4: Blocked -> ready ; Event happens , for example: I/O operation has finished
   * 5: Running -> ready : The process is preempted 进程被抢占, for example: by a **timer interrupt**,此时会发生context switch
   * Running -> exit : process has finished , for example:  program ended or exception encountered.

图中出现了dispatcher

difference between dispatcher and scheduler

相同点： Scheduler and dispatcher are associated with the process **scheduling** of an OS.

 And **scheduling** is the OS's process to decide which process should be allocated to the CPU to execute several processes.

Key difference: Scheduler selects a process out of several processes to be executed. 

​							Dispatcher allocates the CPU for the selected process by the scheduler.

* #### 进程 description

  * 操作控制结构 operating control structure

    每一个进程在运行期间都需要访问特定的系统资源Each process, during execution, needs access to certain system resources.

    例:![image-20211217102014753](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217102014753.png) 

    P1： state: Running (占据processor)	P2：state: blocked (等待I/O)	P3: state: swapped out(不在主内存中)



​			操作系统在表中维护资源信息![image-20211217102526301](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217102526301.png)

**Process table**:  process control blocks

**Memory table: **memory allocation, memory protection, virtual memory

**I/O table: **availability, status, transfer information

**File table:** location, status

重点：

### PCB ---- process control block  ->is Kernel data structure[They are protected and only accessible in kernel mode]

![image-20211217105305408](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217105305408.png)

OS use **PCB**  and **process table** -> manage processes and maintain their information

* PCB contains 3 types of attributes:
  * Process identification(PID,UID, Parent PID)
  * Process state information(**user registers, program counter, stack pointer, program status word, etc.**)
  * Process control information(Process state, scheduling information...)
* And OS manage PCB on the user's behalf(代表) through **System calls**

-----

* #### Process Management

  * OS responsibility -> following activities in connection with process management:

    * Management of process control blocks **PCB**
    * Process **creation and termination**
    * Process **switching**
    * Process scheduling and dispatching 
    * Process synchronization and support for interprocess communication(Concurrency)

    ![image-20211217112833667](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217112833667.png)

  * Process **creation and termination**

    * creation conditions:   1. System initialization
      				 2. Execution of a process creation system call by a running process(fork)
         				 3. A user request to create a new process(shell) shell是一个应用程序，连接了用户和linux内核，让用户能够更高效、安全低成本地使用linux内核
         				 4. initial of a batch job
    * termination conditions: 1. Narmal exit(voluntary)  -> sysytem call *<u>exit</u>*   
      2. Error exit(voluntary) -> program bug, reference nonexistent memory...
      3. Fatal error(involuntary) -> none exit file, bad arguments....
      4. Killed by another process(involuntary)-> system call *<u>kill</u>*

  

  * Process **Switching** 

    #### What is Process Switching

    * ​	Morden OS are multiprogramming system

      ​	Multiprogramming : **Partition memory into several pieces, with a different job in each partition.** While one job was waiting for I/O to complete, another job could be using the CPU.  If enough jobs could be held in main memory at once, the CPU could be kept busy nearly 100% of the time.

      definition from lec 03: **CPU's rapid switching back and forth from process to process is called multiprogramm**.

    * Multiprogramm achieved by **alternating processes** and **context switching**

    * Each process has its own flow of control(its own logical program counter)

    * True parallelism require multiple processors

    #### How Process switching

    1. When context switching take place ? 		interrupt

    2. How?  Context switch happens, the system **saves** the state of the old process and **loads** the state of the new process (creates overhead系统开销，见复习笔记1)

       当系统**save** 这个进程时， 它的PCB被更新

       当系统restart/start 进程时， 这个进程的PCB被读取

    #### What happen when context switch take place

    1. Save process state (program counter, register)
    2. Update PCB (running-> ready)
    3. Move PCB to approriate queue(ready queue/ blocked queue)
    4. Run scheduler, select a new process
    5. Update to running state in PCB(selected)
    6. Updated memory structures (memory image)
    7. Restore process

-----

* #### System calls for process management

  * 概念: SYS calls allow a user process to access and execute operating system functions inside the kernel. 且 User programs use system calls to **invoke** operating system services 用户程序调用SYS call 反射操作系统服务

  * SYS call 封装在操作系统的library中

    ![image-20211217150110135](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217150110135.png)

  * ##### Process creation and termination 

    * Creation: 
      * fork()--Unix ;*generate an exact copy of parent > execve()* ; exec系列的系统调用是把当前程序替换成要执行的程序，而fork用来产生一个和当前进程一样的进程（虽然通常执行不同的代码流）。通常运行另一个程序，而同时保留原程序运行的方法是，fork+exec。
      * NTCreateProcess()--Windows
    * NOTE: SYS calls are necessary to notify the OS that the process **has terminated**
      1. Resource must be de-allocate: 资源必须被释放
      2. output must be flushed : 输出必须被刷新
      3. Process admin may have to be carried out
    * Termination:
      * Unix/Linux: exit(), kill(): The exit() function causes normal process termination ; kill() 函数用于发送信号给其他进程， 一些信号可以达到杀死进程的作用

### Question on lec03：

#### What is the key difference between a trap and an interrupt?

![image-20211217152007112](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217152007112.png)

trap definition from textbook: A trap instruction switches the execution mode of a CPU from the user mode to the kernel mode. Traps are raised by the user program to invoke a functionality of the operating system.

例： 当用户程序代码： printf("%s\n",str); 时， 它将反射 write 函数，User mode切换为kernel mode， 当task完成， kernel mode 返回 user mode

Interrupt is raied by hardware device. 因此， interrupt随时可以发生



#### Difference: A trap is a signal raised from user program that indicates the OS to perform on some functionality immediately while interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware indicating an event that needs immediate attention.
