* #### Construction and organisation of hard disk



* #### Access times of hard disks

T<sub>t</sub> = 

T<sub>S</sub> = 

T<sub>r</sub> (rotation time)= 

**Disk fragmentation:** some space in the last disk block will be wasted in files whose length is not an integral number of blocks

And this is **external fragmentation.**

#### Construction of hear disks

Disks are constructed as multiple aluminum铝/glass covered with magnetizable可磁化 material

* **Read/write** **heads** fly just above the surface (0.2 – 0.07mm) and are connected to a single disk arm  controlled by a single actuator执行器

* Data is stored on both sides
* Common diameters range from 1.8-3.5 inches普通直径在1.8-3.5英寸之间
* Hard disks rotate at constant speed( 外围速度大于内围)

A disk controller sits between the CPU and the drive驱动器

Hard disks are currently about 4 orders of  magnitude slower than main memory硬盘比主存慢四个数量级

* #### Low level Format

Disk are organized in 

1. **Cylinders**圆柱体： a collection of tracks in the same relative position to the spindle轴

2. **Tracks**[Track在录音中指记录载体（例如磁带）上可以记录音频信号的通路。在专业录音领域通常译作“轨”。]: A concentric circle on a single platter side

3. **Sectors**: segments of a track (usually 512B or 4KB in size)![image-20211222213944532](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222213944532.png)

   Sectors usually have an equal number of bytes in them, consisting of a  **preamble**前导码, **data**, and an **error correcting code**

* The number  of sectors increase from the inner side of the disk to the outside

* Disks usually have a **cylinder skew**( An **offset** is added to sector 0 in adjacent tracks to account for the seek time )
* Note that as a result of this low-level formatting, **disk capacity is reduced**![image-20211222214206631](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222214206631.png)

#### Accessing hard disks

* #### Access Time

access time = seek time + rotational delay + transfer time

seek time = time needed to **move the arm to the cylinder**(dominant控制)

Rotational latency = time **before the sector appears under the head**  (on average half the rotation time平均一半的旋转时间)

Transfer time = time to transfer the data

![image-20211222215025867](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222215025867.png)



* #### Multiple request may be happening at the same time(concurrently)==>access time may be increased by a *queueing time*

  • In this scenario, dominance of seek time leaves room for  **optimization** by carefully considering **the order of read operations** 

![image-20211222215455588](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222215455588.png)



访问时间计算公式：

The estimate seek time：<img src="C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222215600603.png" alt="image-20211222215600603" style="zoom:50%;" />

*T<sub>S</sub> :* estimate seek time;	*n:* the **number of  tracks** to be crossed;	

*m*: The crossing time per track	 *s*:  any  additional startup delay 

例题： assume a disk that **rotates at 3600 rpm** (**common rotation speeds are between 3600 and 15000 rpm**) 

*rpm: revolutions Per Minute* 转每分， 表示设备每分钟的旋转次数

一次旋转所需时间：
$$
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{3600}{60(分秒换算)*1000(秒，毫秒换算)} = 16.7ms
$$
因为平均旋转等待时间(T<sub>S</sub>)大约为单次旋转时间的一半：8.3ms

***b***-->the **number of bytes transferred**, *N* the **number of bytes per track**, and rpm the rotation speed in rotations per minute, the transfer time *T<sub>t</sub>, is given by:*

![image-20211222222107690](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222222107690.png)



b(number of byte) /N(number of byte/a track) = 1/track



#### Some example of access time

1. Read a file of size 256 sectors with:

   *T<sub>S</sub>* : 20 ms (Average seek time)

   32 sectors/a track

Contiguous : The file is stored as compact as possible.        All sectors on 8 consecutive连续的 tracks of 32 sector

Thus,

The **first track** takes: seek time + rotational delay + transfer time = 20+8.3+16.7 = 45 ms

假设没有cylinder skew,忽略small seeks between tracks

剩下的track takes：	only rotational delay + transfer time:	8.3=16.7 = 25ms

total time = 45(firet track takes) + 7*25(last seven tracks) = 220ms = 0.22s

访问不是有序的， 而是随机的(random for the sectors)

thus,	Time per second = *T<sub>S</sub>* +*T<sub>r</sub>*+*T<sub>t</sub>* = 20+8.3+0.5 = 28.8ms

T<sub>t</sub> = 16.7 * 1/32 = 0.5

Total time = 256 sector = 256*28.8ms = 7.37s

- It is important to position the sectors carefully and void **disk fragmentation**

### Disk scheduling 硬盘调度

* ##### The OS must use the hardware efficiently:

  * The file system can position/organise files strategically.
  * **Having multiple disk** requests in a queue allows us to minimise the arm movement多个磁盘请求在一个队列中允许了最小化arm movement

* Every I/O operation go through a **system call**, allowing **OS to interception the request** and resequence.

* If driver or controller is **free** -> request can be **serviced immediately**
* if driver or controller is **not free** -> request will be **queued**

- In a **dynamic situation**, several I/O request will be made over time that keep in a table of request sectors **per cylinder**

### Disk scheduling algorithm 硬盘调度算法

disk scheduling algorithm determine the **order** in which disk events are processed

以下算法均不是最佳算法，假设36 个cylinder， numbered 1 to 36



----

#### FCFS - first come first served

process the request in the order that they arrive

例：以下序列为硬盘请求的cylinder location：

11， 1， 36， 16， 34， 9， 12

使用FCFS算法： 总长度为：|11-1|(从第11个cylinder 到第1个cylinder的长度) + |1-36|+|36-16|+|16-34|+|34-9|+|9-12| = 111

---

#### Shortest Seek time first

Selects the request that is closest to the  current head position to reduce head movement

使用SSTF算法获得的长度：|11-12|+|12-9|+|9-16|+|16-1|+|1-34|+|34-36| = 61，几乎比FCFS算法小50%

缺点：

* SSTF could result in startvation:
  * The arm stays in the middle of the disk in case of heavy load,  **edge cylinders** are poorly served, the strategy is unfair
  * Continuously arriving requests **for the same location** could starve  other regions

---

#### SCAN -lift algorithm

definition：keep moving in the same direction until  end is reached (start upwards)

* It continues in the current direction, servicing all pending requests as it  passes over them
* When it gets to the **last cylinder**, it reverses direction and services all  the pending requests (until it reaches the first cylinder)
* 使用SCAN算法获得的长度：|11-12|+|12-16|+|16-34|+|34-36|+|36-9|+|9-1| = 60，

Advantage： 

The upper limit on the "waiting time" is 2*number of cylinders  --->  **no startvation occurs**

Disadvantage: The middle cylinders are favoured if the disk is heavily used(边界的cylinder需要等待两倍的时间)

---

#### C-SCAN

disadvantage of SCAN algprithm: Once the outer/inner side of the disk is reached, the requests at the other end of the disk have been waiting longest

improved by using **circular scan**

* The disk arm moves in one direction servicing requests
* When it gets to the last cylinder of the disk, it reverses direction but it  **does not service requests on the return journey**
* Once it gets back to the first cylinder it reverses direction, and **again services requests**
* It is **fairer** and **equalises** response times across a disk than SCAN
* 使用C-SCAN算法获得的长度：|11-12|+|12-16|+|16-34|+|34-36|+|36-1|+|1-9| = 68

---

N-step-SCAN

definition: Seeks are **cylinder by cylinder**, and once cylinder contains multiple tracks.



**N-step-SCAN** only services *N* requests every single sweep

---

#### Some observation of scheduling algorithm

调度算法的性能取决于requests/load of the disk 

​	if 1 request a time, FCFS will perform equally weel as any other algorithm

---

#### SSD- Solid State Driver

have **no** moving parts and store data using **electrical circuits**

- no T<sub>seek</sub> or rotational delay
- much better random I/O performance than disks
- FCFS algorithm is usful 
- But SSTF， SCAN，CSCAN may reduce performance(Bcauz , no **head to move**)
