#### The Producer/Consumer Problem

##### 1. one consumer, one producer, unbounded buffer

##### 



##### 2. Multiple consumers, multiple producers, bounded buffer

A different variant of the problem has **n** consumers, **m**  producers, and a fixed buffer size **N**. The solution is based on 3  semaphores:

* **Sync**: used to **enforce mutual exclusion** for the buffer
* **empty**: keeps track of the number of **empty buffers**, initialized to N, if buffer is full -> semaphore =0
* **full**: keeps track of the number of full buffers, initialized to 0

##### empty and full are counting semaphores

#### Dining Philosophers Problem

1.描述

五个哲学家围绕着圆桌坐下，每个人有一盘意大利面。意大利面太滑了，每个哲学家需要两个叉子才能吃东西

当饥肠辘辘的时候(在思考的时候)，哲学家就会试图得到他左右两边的叉子。

这反映了分享有限的资源给一些进程的问题



叉子代表了信号量（初始化为1）

* 1 if the fork is available: the philosopher can continue
* 0 if the fork is not available: the philosopher goes to sleep if trying to acquire.



1.第一种方法：

所有哲学家拿起一个叉子（不放下）并且等待第二个叉子能够使用

——可能会造成Deadlock

避免deadlock：

2.第二种方法

Global mutex/semaphore

1.Before starting to acquire forks, a philosopher would do a down on mutex[加锁]

2.After replacing the forks, she would do an up on mutex[解锁]

从理论角度看，这个解决办法是合适的，但是从实际角度看，任何情况下只有一个哲学家能够吃意面

但是在有五个叉子的情况下，应该有两个哲学家同时在吃意面



3.第三种办法，没有死锁且能达到最大并行

Use an array ***state***-->to keep track of whether a philosopher is eating, thinking, or hungry.

A philosopher may move into eating only neither neighbor is eating.

Philosopher i’s neighbors are defined by the macros ***LEFT*** and ***RIGHT***. In other words, if i is 2, ***LEFT*** is 1 and ***RIGHT*** is 3.



***Text book problem***

In the dining philosophers problem, let the following protocol be used: An **even-numbered** philosopher always **picks up his left fork before picking up his right fork**; an **odd-numbered** philosopher always **picks up his right fork before picking up his left fork.** Will this protocol guarantee deadlock-free operation??

Yes. There will be always at least one fork free and at least one philosopher that can obtain both forks simultaneously. Hence, there will be no deadlock.
