***lec quiz***

Which is not deadlock condition?

A. mutual exclusion		B. hold and wait		C. circular wait		D. preemption

D--because deadlock only occurs in non-preemption resources





#### 从死锁中恢复：

**Preemption** 优先抢占：the resource is forcefully removed from one of the processes (this is likely to have an ill effect)资源被强制从其中一个进程中删除

* Take a resource away from a process, have another process use it, and then give it back. (difficult/impossible)一个进程从另一进程拿走资源，然后再还给它是困难甚至不可能的

**Rollback mechanisms**: build in check points that allow the  process to be restarted (periodically)

构建允许进程(定期)重新启动的检查点(similar to debug)

*  The check points contain the **memory image** and **resource states**

* Multiple checkpoints should be maintained (not overwrite)

* The process that owns the "deadlocked" resource is rolled back

  ​	有死锁资源的进程为rolled back

**Kill** a strategically chosen **process** to release its resources-直接杀死选择的进程来释放它的资源

* The process should be easy to restart

* The process can be re-run from the beginning with no ill effect (no preemption)

  #### Deadlock Avoidance避免死锁

##### 1. Deadlock detection approaches are reactive检测死锁的方法是被动的

​	例如这些方法只是检测，和从死锁中恢复，而不是阻止死锁

##### 2. Deadlocks can be avoided by carefully considering resource allocation( 小心地考虑资源分配能够避免死锁)



*Q: 1. Is the system in a state that is currently not deadlocked yet, but will **ultimately result in a deadlock**?*

系统能够处于当前没有死锁但最终会导致死锁的状态?



Q: 2. Can I **allocate this resource safely** without causing a potential deadlock later on?

 我可以安全地分配这个资源而不会在以后引起潜在的死锁吗?



* #### Single resource

  A **safe state** is one where there is **a feasible order** for the  processes to finish **without deadlock.**

  安全状态是指在没有死锁的情况下，有一个可行的进程结束顺序
  
  ##### 例： Consider the following example for a single resource, assuming that 10 entities exist for the given resource (Has, Max):![](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222163212859.png)



Safe state is B->C->A	There is no deadlock happening.





##### 		例：Consider the following example (A gets an extra resource in (b)), again assuming that 10 instances exist for the given resource: 

##### 		• The state in b is not yet deadlocked, but will deadlock eventually![](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222163840752.png)

在刚开始时，进程A得到了额外的资源，导致了死锁

if A get an extra resource, deadlock would happen,顺序：A->B->deadlock





#### Banker Algorithm（single, multiple）银行家算法

* A state might not be in deadlock, but still be unsafe

* 银行家算法能够用于避免死锁

  1. Find customer closest to max resource allocation
  2. Check whether remaining resources can satisfy the maximum request
  3. Return the resources from this process to the set of available resources
  4. Find next process closest to its max resource allocation.

  ##### The state is safe iff all processes can finish, even when they request all their resources at the same time.



* #### Multiple resources

  The bankers algorithm for multiple resources is a generalisation of  the banker algorithm for a single resource

  2 矩阵

  ​	**C**  for the **allocated** resources.

  ​	**R** for the **remaining resources** that are required

  3向量

  1. existing resources	存在的资源
  2. the possessed resources 拥有的资源
  3. the available resources  可用的资源

step:

1. Find a row in R for which all corresponding resource requirements are less or equal to A
   1. if no row satisfies this, the state is unsafe
   2. else ' run the process' and add its resources to A
2. Repeat the above until all processes have finished
   1. The state is safe if all processes complete successfully

e.g.

Can process B be granted a printer?

 yes![image-20211222165803845](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222165803845.png)

Can process B and E both be granted a printer?

no![image-20211222165949886](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211222165949886.png)
