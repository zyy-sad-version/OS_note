* #### introduction to process scheduling

  * Process Behavior

    * **CPU bound** processes:   spend most of their time doing calculations on the CPU (i.e., they have very long CPU bursts)
    * **I/O bound** processes: spend most of their time doing I/O, using very little CPU time (i.e., they have very short  CPU bursts)

    Aim of process scheduling: Assign processes to be executed by the processor or processors over time, with good **response time**响应时间, **throughput**吞吐量, and **processor efficiency**处理器效率.



------

* #### Types of process schedulers

##### Classification by Time Horizon: 

General -> specificate

1. **Long term scheduling** applies to new processes and controls the degree of  multiprogramming
   - decide which processes to admit to the system
   - A good mix of CPU and I/O bound processes is favorable to keep all resources as busy as possible (两者占比最佳-> 尽可能使资源最大化利用)

1. **Medium term scheduling**: controls swapping and the degree of multi-programming in main memory. (**Memory management**)
2. **Short term scheduling** (dispatcher) : decide which process to run next
   * Usually called in response to clock interrupts, I/O interrupts, blocking system calls, or semaphores
   * Invoked very frequently, hence must be fast
   * Manages the **ready queue**

Short-term scheduling / dispatcher

1. 决定下一个运行的进程， 即管理ready queue
2. 决定何时interrupt 进程。（例如 IO 抢占当前进程， timer interrupt）

Dispatcher决定下一个运行的进程取决于它使用的scheduling algorithm， 而 scheduling algorithm 的类型被OS类型影响（interactive , batch)



##### Classification by approach

1. Non-preemptive: processes are only interrupted voluntarily (e.g., I/O operation or “nice” system call – yield()让进程从running状态变为ready状态并重新再竞争CPU的调度权)
2. Preemptive: processes can be interrupted forcefully
   1. . preemptive scheduling algorithm picks a process and lets it run for a maximum of some fixed time. (clock interrupt)以固定时间段打断
   2. This requires context switches, which generate overhead, too many of them should be  avoided 
   3. Prevents processes from monopolizing the CPU组织进程垄断CPU

* #### Evaluation criteria for scheduling algorithms **important!!

##### Criteria标准

面向用户标准： 

​	response time响应时间: minimize the time between creating the job and its first execution

​	Turnaround time 周转时间： minimize the time between creating the job and finishing it

​	Predictability可预测性: minimize the variance in processing times最小化处理时间的差异

面向系统标准：（focus on 进程的有效利用）

​	吞吐量Throughput：最大化每小时的线程处理量

​	公平Fairness：1.Are processing power/waiting time equally distributed 	2. Are some processes kept waiting excessively long (**starvation**:  All the programs continue to run indefinitely but fail to make any progress.)

NOTE: reducing the response time may increase context switches and may worsen the throughput and increase the turnaround time.

------

* #### Typical process scheduling algorithms

1. #### Overview

   **Algorithm:** 

   ​	First Come First Served(FCFS) (batch system)

   ​	Shortest job first (batch system)

   ​	Round Robin(interactive system)

    <u>*Interactive systems are general purpose and may run arbitrary programs that are not cooperative and even possibly malicious.*</u>

   ​	Priority queues(interactive system)

   **Performance measure used:**

   平均响应时间

   平均周转时间

2. **FCFS**

   非抢占算法，按照priority，length 进CPU

   ![image-20211217171320619](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217171320619.png)



Advantages: positional fairness and easy to implement

Disadvantages:  Favours long processes over short ones;  		Favours CPU bounds processes over I/O bounds ones.

2. **Shortest job first** 

   非抢占式， 最短的先![image-20211217171800525](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217171800525.png)

   Advantage： always result in the optimal turn around time周转时间永远是最佳

   Disadvantage： Starvation might occur；	Fairness and predictability are compromised； 	Processing times have to be known beforehand or estimated by

3. **Round Robin** 

   a preemptive version of FCFS that forces context switches at periodic intervals周期间隔 or time slices时间切片

* 进程有序地运行（在队列中的顺序）
* 进程会被timer强行打断
* if a time slice is only used partially, the next process starts immediately

![image-20211217183525871](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217183525871.png)

Advantage: 

1. Improved response time

2. Effective for general purpose time-sharing system.

*time-sharing system*.*分时操作系统：分时操作系统是使一台计算机采用时间片轮转的方式同时为几个、几十个甚至几百个用户服务的一种操作系统。*

Disadvantage:

1. Increased context switching and thus overhead

2.  Favours CPU bound processes (which usually run long) over I/O processes  (which do not run long) - how can this be prevented?
3. can reduce to FCFS(worse state)

当使用RR调度算法时需要谨慎考虑**时间切片的长度**

实例： Assuming muti-programming system with preemptive scheduling and a context switch time of 1 ms:

如果达到低响应时间with small time slice（例1ms），将会导致低吞吐量

如果实现高吞吐量with large time slice（例1000ms）， 将会导致较长的响应时间



4**.Priority Queue**

 A preemptive algorithm that schedules processes by  priority (high to low)且该队列储存在PCB中

![image-20211217191303324](C:\Users\DLZ\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211217191303324.png)

Advantage: can prioritise I/O bound jobs

Disadvantages: low priority processes may suffer from starvation(with static priorities)

低优先级的进程可能会饥饿

### Past Paper question:

1. There are several design goals in scheduling algorithms. In the user-oriented perspective,  list and describe the criteria to evaluate these algorithms. Give an example where these  criteria can be conflicting

*My answer: in the user-oriented perspective, response time, turn around time, predictability are criteria to evaluate scheduling algorithms. For example, 1. if reducing response time, may increase context switching and worsen the throughput and increase the turn around time.*



2. Illustrate the use of a Round Robin algorithm for the runnable process list given below.

   (1) Assuming all the processes arrive at time 0, illustrate times when processes  start and finish running (you can use Gantt charts similar to the ones used in  the lecture slides to illustrate this or a table). List the times for each context  switch in your illustration. You can assume that the time slice is 15  milliseconds (if you were to need this)

(2) Calculate the average response time for the round robin algorithm.

average response time  = 0+15+15+15=45/4=11.25

(3) Calculate the average turnaround time for the round robin algorithm.

average turn around time = 45+95+115+125=380/4=95
